#warning("bugs and solutions")
/*
 Bugs, which are already found:
  1) Memory Leak with Audio
  2) Beineler's data is messing when a network is slow
  3) SkeletonView doesn't work properly: the first index of the CV is not animating(should look for an alternative) - this version isn't working with skeleton view
 Solutions, which will be integrated further:
  1) Back segue falling leaves
  2) Shuffle animation of cards
  3) ModuleView protocol properties get acccessor
  4) Karaoke Scrolling Text
  5) The audio shouldn't play while user is holding slider(PlaylistItem)
