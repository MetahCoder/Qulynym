 Bugs, which are already found:
  1) Memory Leak with Audio
  2) Audio queue isn't optimizing the main thread
  3) Preschool module's scroll view - content is ambigious
  4) Eraser draws white on picture
  5) Item quit animation is different from pushing back to the rootVC, maybe leak, idk
  6) Auto Layout on IPad: Karaoke Module(video view & Titles), closeBtn
 Solutions, which will be integrated further:
  1) TimerController on another queue
  2) Back segue falling leaves
  3) Video queue
  4) Design Pattern of the Project
  5) Item should quit to their menu
